# **CVE-2024-51377: Stored HTML Injection in Servicedesk Module**

It was identified that the "Subject" and "Identifier" fields within the FaveoCloud application are vulnerable to stored HTML injection. When creating a new problem or change, an attacker can inject malicious HTML code into these fields. This injected code is stored and later executed when the relevant page is accessed, leading to potential issues such as unauthorized script execution or page defacement. Testing confirmed that the injected payloads are successfully executed, indicating a stored HTML injection vulnerability.
